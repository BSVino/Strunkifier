===============

**Why Strunkify?** - William Strunk Jr. was an English professor at Cornell around the turn of the century. He wrote a small textbook for the students of his English class. One of these students was E. B. White, who would later become a writer at _The New Yorker_ and the author of _Stuart Little_ and _Charlotte's Web_. White eventually [published Strunk's book](http://www.amazon.com/Elements-Style-Fourth-William-Strunk/dp/020530902X) and it became a widely used English style guide. The book sets out guidelines on how to be a clearer, more concise writer, with brevity and the reduction of unnecessary language as its main goals. This page is a utility which detects and warns about a number of problematic words and phrases that Strunk outlined in his book.
